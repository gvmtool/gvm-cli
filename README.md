SDKMAN is a tool for managing parallel Versions of multiple Software Development Kits on any Unix-based system. It provides a convenient command-line interface for installing, switching, removing, and listing Candidates.

See documentation on the [SDKMAN! website](https://sdkman.io).

## NOTICE

**We are rewriting all the commands for SDKMAN! in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) under a [new project](https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli-native) that supplements this one. Only bug fixes to supporting code will be
accepted in this project. As a result, no further enhancements will be accepted on the commands in this project, and the commands here will be phased out in due course. This project will eventually form a lightweight
wrapper/launcher for the replacement Rust commands.**

## Installation

Open your favourite terminal and enter the following:

    $ curl -s https://get.sdkman.io | bash

If the environment needs tweaking for SDKMAN to be installed, the installer will prompt you accordingly and ask you to restart.

## Running the Cucumber Features

All SDKMAN's BDD tests describing the CLI behaviour are written in Cucumber and can be found under `src/test/resources/features`. These can be run with Gradle by running the following command:

    $ ./gradlew test

To perform development, you will need to have a JDK 11 installed which can be obtained by running the following after installing SDKMAN:

    $ sdk env install
